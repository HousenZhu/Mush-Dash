# Mush Dash - A 2D Adventure Game
Mush Dash is an engaging 2D animation game developed in C, designed for the DE1-SoC board or the [CPUlater ARMv7](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc) platform.

## How to Play
Control your hero character using the up & down keys on the keyboard or keys 0 & 1 on the DE1-SoC board to navigate through obstacles and evade enemies.

For those seeking a challenge, collect points by attacking enemies from above or below. Adjust the game's difficulty with the SW0 switch on the board, and track your progress with LEDs.

Your adventure has a timer that counts down from a set amount. When it hits zero, your game ends.

## Getting Started
### DE1-SoC Board
1. Upload the game code to the FPGA board.

2. Connect a VGA monitor.

3. Power on the board, and the game will start automatically.

### [CPUlater ARMv7](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc)

1. Copy the code from the 'final project' file.

2. Paste it into CPUlater ARMv7, switching to the C language.

3. Click 'Compile and Load' and 'Continue' buttons sequently on the top of screen.

4. Find your essential tools in the 'Device' menu on the right, including switches, seven-segment HEX displays, LEDs, the VGA screen, and keyboard inputs.



Mush Dash is not just a game; it's a test of strategy and reflexes. Choose your path—collect points, dodge enemies, or defeat them—to become the ultimate hero.

Get ready to embark on your adventure!
